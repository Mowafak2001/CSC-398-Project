To identify the top 10 attackers, I calculated a performance metric for each player that goes beyond just the number of goals scored. It includes factors like goals scored, assists provided, expected goals based on chance quality, shots on target, significant opportunities missed, and the percentage of goals scored relative to attempts.
How the weights were distributed:
Goals (×6): Goals are the primary measure of an attacker so they are weighted the most.
Assists (×4): Assists indicate the players ability and are highly valued but less than goals.
Expected Goals (×2): It shows the quality of scoring chances giving an idea about shot creation.
Shots on Target (×1.5): Indicates the accuracy.
Big Chances Missed (×-2): Penalty for missing significant opportunities which could hurt team outcomes.
Goal Conversion % (+1): It shows the efficiency in converting opportunities into goals.
