Attackers
To identify the top 10 attackers, we calculated a performance metric for each player that goes beyond just the number of goals scored. It includes factors like goals scored, assists provided, expected goals based on chance quality, shots on target, significant opportunities missed, and the percentage of goals scored relative to attempts. The key metrics used were:

Goals: The primary measure of an attacker, weighted the most.
Assists: Indicates the player’s ability to create chances, highly valued but less than goals.
Expected Goals: Shows the quality of scoring chances, giving an idea about shot creation.
Shots on Target: Reflects the accuracy of the player’s shooting.
Big Chances Missed: A penalty for missing significant opportunities that could impact team outcomes.
Goal Conversion %: Measures the efficiency in converting chances into goals.


Defenders
For defenders, we used the following performance metrics:

Tackles
Interceptions
Clean Sheets
Errors Leading to Goals
Dribbled Past
Clearances
These metrics were chosen to evaluate defenders based on their ability to break up attacks, protect their goal, and minimize errors.

Midfielders
For midfielders, we considered the following performance metrics:

Assists
Total Passes
Accurate Passes %
Key Passes
Accurate Long Ball %
Accurate Passes
These metrics measure a midfielder’s playmaking ability, passing accuracy, and their involvement in creating scoring opportunities.

Goalkeepers
For goalkeepers, we calculated the following performance metrics:

Saves
Clean Sheets
Penalty Kicks Saved
Saves from Inside the Box
Runs Out
These metrics assess the goalkeeper's ability to prevent goals, save penalties, and protect the goal area.
This project was a collaborative effort by our entire team—Mowafak Seidahmed, Massour Oroubode, and Ricardo Carneiro. We worked together on all aspects of the project, from planning and development to testing and presentation preparation. Ricardo manually created the CSV files for nearly 700 players, as there was no database available to download data from the recent season. Mowafak and Massour focused on the modeling aspects of the project. Additionally, linear regression was added to the Colab code for further analysis.
